# Milken-Knights-Rapid-React
## ~~stolen~~ code from
#### SWERVE DRIVE:
- team 6624 - best path code and 180 awarness code
- team 1684 - 180 awarness code
- ether (chief delphi) - swerve drive  
<br/>

#### SWERVE AUTONOMOUS:
- team 3244 - basic auto structure and pidf config
- team 7166 - orginization of auto and they had a similar auto
<br/>

## HOW TO USE:
- not really user friendly rn, all you need to do is change the constants (i think)
- also download the Better Comments extension for color coded comments
- all functions should have javadocs. if they dont, they are either not mine and more info about them can be found on there own documentation page, or its mine and i forgot to add a javadoc
