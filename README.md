     - team 6624 - best path code and 180 awarness code
     - team 1684 - 180 awarness code
     - ether (chief delphi) - swerve drive  
<br/>

- ### SWERVE AUTONOMOUS:
     - team 3244 - basic auto structure and pidf config
     - team 7166 - organization of auto and they had a similar auto
<br/>

     - Programming Done Right - toggle button
     - Everyone whos code I used but forgot to cite - most things
<br/>

- our robot is decked out with the finest gear, as you can clearly see from these descriptive descriptions!
<br/>

## Robot Features
- ### Teleop
     - Flawless user controlled swerve with no drift and can even fly
     - Intake balls from miles away with our great intake
     - Shoot balls with perfect accuracy (up to 48 inches) so much accuracy, thank you imaginary limelight!
     - Climb traversal (actually works) automatically or manually
- ### Autonomous
     - 20 ball auto, 100% works everytime, only takes 7 seconds
- ### Self Defence
     - Turn baby mode off and spin like a beyblade to freak the crap out of your opponents!
     - Spontaneously dissasemble to confuse your opponents and teamates alike
- our robot is very high tech and advanced, and is even a work in progress!
<br/>

## HOW TO USE:
- not really user friendly rn, all you need to do is change the constants (i think)
- also download the Better Comments extension for color coded comments
- all functions and most variables should have javadocs. if they dont, they are either not mine and more info about them can be found on there own documentation page, or its mine and i forgot to add a javadoc
